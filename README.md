## How we built this documentation

### MkDocs

We used Mkdocs to build this documentation as it is a static site generator that is geared towards building project documentation fast and quickly. In addition we were able to use the [Mkdocs Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and incorporate additional styles to make the documentation look more visually appealing.

## Overview

### What is Passport.js?

Passport JS is a widely used middleware for handling authentication in Node.js web applications.

It can help you save a lot of time and effort in implementing authentication and managing user sessions in your web applications.

The topics covered in the documentation are:

- Configuring Passport.js

## How we built this documentation

This documentation was built using our knowledge of the topic from our [COMP 2523 Object Oriented Programming](https://www.bcit.ca/outlines/20231087556/) course at BCIT. In addition we also looked at the official documentation for Passport.js to get a better understanding of the topic.

### MkDocs

We used Mkdocs to build this documentation as it is a static site generator that is geared towards building project documentation fast and quickly. In addition we were able to use the [Mkdocs Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and incorporate additional styles to make the documentation look more visually appealing.

### Markdown

The documentation was written entirely in markdown using Visual Studio Code.

We learned how to add the following things into our documentation using markdown:

- Code snippets
- Images
- Links

## Learning Outcomes

From building this documentation we learned how to write clear and concise instructions to communicate to users how to use a certain technology.

We have also gained valuable experience in working with Markdown and using Mkdocs to create a documentation website and this experience will help us make a documentation site quickly in the future for web technologies that we may develop or be working on.
